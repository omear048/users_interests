Templates (or view templates)
Templates (or view templates) are files that contain text that is converted into HTML before being sent to a user's browser in a response. There are a lot of different templating languages, and they all provide different ways to define what HTML to generate and how to embed dynamic values.


<%= @title %> vs. <% @title%>
- <% @title %> => Any Ruby code can be pasted into .erb template files as long as it's between the <% %>
- <%= @title %> => To display the dynamic value within the .erb template file the "=" must be present <%= @title %> 

Template Files
.erb is a template file

Route Parameters (:number)
- By adding route parameters to the URL you can reduce duplication 
- Values passed to the application through the URL in this way appear in the params Hash that is automatically made available in routes.

get "/show/:name" do
  params[:name]
end


Before Filters
- We can move this common code into a before filter so that we only need to define it once in the program. Sinatra will run the code in a before filter before running the code in a matching route, so it's a good place to setup globally needed data. 

before do
  @contents = File.readlines("data/toc.txt")
end
